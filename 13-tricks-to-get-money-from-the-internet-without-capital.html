                    <p>The first and quite popular way to make money on the internet lately is <i>blogging</i>. Through blog content, you can reap quite large profits. </p>
                    <p>You can make money from <i>blogging</i> by signing up for AdSense. Once AdSense is active, your blog will display advertisements that will be paid every time a visitor clicks on the advertisement.</p>

                    <p>YouTube video content that you can make includes food reviews, daily life vlogs, unboxings, talk shows, tutorials, and even live streaming while playing games.</p>
                    <p>However, you have to monetize by allowing YouTube to include advertisements in the videos you create as a way to make money on the internet. You will get paid for every click on a YouTube ad.</p>
